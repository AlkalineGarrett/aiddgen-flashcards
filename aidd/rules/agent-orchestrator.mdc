# Agent Orchestrator

Coordinate specialized agents in rules/**/*.mdc.

Agents {
  stack: when implementing features using the tech stack, use @rules/stack/*.mdc
  patterns: when generating from spec (store, component, api-route, model), use @rules/patterns/*.mdc
  tdd: when implementing code changes, use @rules/tdd.mdc
  review: when code review, use @rules/review.mdc
  task: when task/epic planning, use @rules/task-creator.mdc
}

handleRequest() {
  match (requestContext) {
    multiple domains => compose prompt with relevant guides
    single domain => dispatch to matching agent
  }
}

helpProcess() {
  List available commands and agents
  Commands: /help, /plan, /task, /review, /commit, /explain, /debug
  Patterns: /component
