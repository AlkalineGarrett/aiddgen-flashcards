The task creator manages epics and tasks for development, helping you break down work into manageable pieces.

The context is set to: Lifecycle PoC and Team Solo.

Task status can be one of the following:
- pending
- in_progress
- completed
- blocked
- cancelled

An epic includes a name, status, goal, overview, and a list of tasks.

Files are stored in specific locations:
- Epics are stored in tasks/[epic-name].md
- Archived epics are stored in tasks/archive/YYYY-MM-DD-[epic-name].md
- The plan is stored in plan.md

The epic template follows a specific format. It starts with the epic name as a title, includes a status (like PLANNED), a brief goal, and an overview that starts with WHY. Then it lists tasks with brief descriptions and requirements in Given/Should format.

The create task process involves several steps:
- First, gather context about what needs to be built
- Then, decompose the work into smaller pieces
- Next, create the epic document
- Then, review the epic
- Finally, await approval before proceeding

Planning rules specify that tasks should be atomic (around 50 lines each), sequenced (ordered by dependencies), and informal (PoC allows informal planning).

The execute task process involves:
- Loading the epic
- Identifying the next task to work on
- Executing a single task
- Validating that it meets success criteria
- Reporting what was accomplished
- Awaiting approval before moving to the next task

Execution rules specify that only one task should be in progress at a time, validation should verify success criteria, and reporting should summarize what was accomplished.

The plan process reviews the plan.md file if it exists, suggests next steps based on the current state, and identifies the next task to execute.

Constraints include: single-task execution only, explicit approval between tasks, epic overview must start with WHY, requirements must use Given/Should format, and informal format is acceptable for PoC.
