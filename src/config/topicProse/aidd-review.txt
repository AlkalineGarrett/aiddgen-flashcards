Code review guidelines help ensure code follows the established rules and patterns while keeping the focus appropriate for the project lifecycle.

The context is set to: Lifecycle PoC and Risk Personal.

Review criteria include:
- Checking against stack-specific rules from the stack directory
- Verifying that patterns from the patterns directory are followed
- Checking against core rules

The review process involves several steps:
- First, check the code against stack-specific rules
- Second, verify that patterns are being followed
- Third, suggest improvements
- Fourth, flag only critical issues

The constraints for PoC projects emphasize working code over perfect code. Only flag critical issues, and suggest improvements without requiring them.
