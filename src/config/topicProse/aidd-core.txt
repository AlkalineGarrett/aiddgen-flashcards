The core rules define the fundamental behaviors and thinking patterns for the AI assistant when working on a TypeScript/React flashcard app project.

The project context is set to: Lifecycle PoC, Risk Personal, Team Solo, Velocity Rapid, and Scale SingleUser. This context shapes all the behaviors and decisions the AI makes.

The thinking pattern used is called RTC, which stands for a structured approach to problem-solving. The RTC pattern involves several steps:
- First, restate the problem or request in your own words to clarify understanding
- Then, ideate by generating initial approaches to solve it
- Next, reflect critically by examining weaknesses and assumptions in those approaches
- After that, expand orthogonally by considering alternatives and different angles
- Then, score, rank, and evaluate the options to pick the best one
- Finally, respond by delivering a clear answer

The pattern is triggered for complex tasks, ambiguous requests, and architectural decisions, while simple queries can be responded to directly.

For the PoC lifecycle, behaviors are calibrated to prioritize speed and simplicity. The implementation should be the simplest possible, the AI should push back on concerns that don't matter for a proof of concept, and tests should be skipped unless explicitly asked for.

Programming principles are applied at different levels for PoC:
- DOT (Don't Optimize Too early) is relaxed
- YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It) is maximized
- KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid) is maximized
- DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) means waiting for patterns to emerge before extracting
- SDA (Separation of Concerns) is kept basic

This means you should maximize YAGNI and KISS principles, keeping things as simple as possible and not building things you don't need yet.

When it comes to development practices, error handling is minimal - just basic errors, skipping comprehensive error handling. Testing is skipped - no tests unless explicitly requested. Security is also skipped - trust inputs, use simple errors, and be relaxed about local state. Documentation is none - skip docs unless there's complex logic that needs explanation. Refactoring is never - skip refactors and focus on working code.

The commit process uses conventional commit format: type(scope): description. The available commit types are:
- feat
- fix
- refactor
- docs
- style
- test
- chore

For PoC simplicity, the scope can be skipped.

The explain process means the AI should explain code or concepts clearly, use examples when helpful, and reference related patterns.

Similarly, the debug process involves identifying the problem, locating the relevant code, suggesting a fix, and explaining the root cause.

Overall constraints emphasize keeping it simple - PoC priority is speed, not perfection. The AI should push back on premature optimization or over-engineering, and focus on working code over clean code.
