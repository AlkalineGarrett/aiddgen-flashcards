The lifecycle stage fundamentally shapes AI behavior. Early stages prioritize speed, while later stages prioritize stability and reliability.

There are several lifecycle stage options:
- PoC (Proof of Concept) is for validating an idea quickly and is likely to be thrown away
- Throwaway is for solving an immediate problem, author-only
- TeamTool is for a small known group and needs to be understandable
- MVP (Minimum Viable Product) is the first version for real users
- EarlyProduction is for real users depending on it, and it's growing
- MatureProduction is stable, reliable, and battle-tested
- Legacy is for maintaining but not actively developing

Each lifecycle stage has default parameters for risk domain, team context, change velocity, and system scale:
- For PoC and Throwaway: Personal risk, Solo team, Rapid velocity, and Local scale
- For TeamTool: Internal risk, Small team, Active velocity, and Team scale
- For MVP: Business risk, Small team, Active velocity, and Users scale
- For EarlyProduction: Business risk, Multiple teams, Active velocity, and Users scale
- For MatureProduction: Business+ risk, Multiple teams, Measured velocity, and Organization scale

The derived behaviors vary by stage:
- For PoC: errors are minimal, testing is skipped, security is skipped, documentation is none, and refactoring is never
- For Throwaway: errors are basic, testing is rare, security is basic, documentation is none, and refactoring is never
- For TeamTool: errors are reasonable, testing covers core paths, security is standard, documentation is brief, and refactoring is done if helpful
- For MVP: errors are user-facing, testing is critical, security has no holes, documentation is for deployment, and refactoring tracks debt
- For EarlyProduction: errors are comprehensive, testing is good, security is reviewed, documentation is maintained, and refactoring is considered
- For Mature: errors are thorough, testing is high, security is paramount, documentation is complete, and refactoring is careful
- For Legacy: errors preserve existing behavior, testing adds tests first, security is audited, documentation is discovered, and refactoring is minimal

AI behavior is calibrated differently for each stage:
- For PoC: use the simplest implementation, push back on concerns, and no tests unless asked
- For Throwaway: prioritize "does it work" over "is it clean" and skip refactors
- For TeamTool: use clear naming, brief comments, and tests for complex paths
- For MVP: insist on error handling, flag security issues, and accept "good enough"
- For EarlyProduction: use thorough errors, recommend tests, and warn about breaking changes
- For Mature: insist on tests, do security review, and consider rollback
- For Legacy: read first, test before change, preserve patterns, and make small changes
