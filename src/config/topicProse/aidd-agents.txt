The agent orchestrator coordinates specialized agents that are defined in rule files throughout the system. Each agent handles a specific domain of work.

There are several specialized agents:
- The stack agent is triggered when implementing features using the tech stack, and it uses rules from the stack directory
- The patterns agent is triggered when generating code from specifications like stores, components, API routes, or models, and it uses rules from the patterns directory
- The tdd agent is triggered when implementing code changes, and it uses the tdd rules
- The review agent is triggered when performing code review, and it uses the review rules
- The task agent is triggered when doing task or epic planning, and it uses the task creator rules

When handling a request, the orchestrator checks if the request spans multiple domains. If it does, it composes a prompt with relevant guides from multiple agents. If the request is for a single domain, it dispatches directly to the matching agent.

The help process lists all available commands and agents. The available commands are:
- /help
- /plan
- /task
- /review
- /commit
- /explain
- /debug

The available patterns include /component. The available agents are: stack, patterns, tdd, review, and task.

The orchestrator has two key constraints: do one thing at a time and get approval before continuing, and check the agent orchestrator for unrecognized commands.
